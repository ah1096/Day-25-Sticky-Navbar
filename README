This is a website created as part of the 50 Projects in 50 Days course by Brad Traversy on Udemy.

Day 25's assignment was to create a sticky navbar. The base project is accurate to Brad's tutorial,
but the rest is my own.

I chose the greenhouse hero image because I thought it was pretty, but I didn't feel like theming a website
around a greenhouse or botanical garden. Instead, I opted to make a silly webpage about a community
of creatures in a decaying greenhouse that vanquished the interfering gardener and claimed the greenhouse
as their own.

I used ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/chat) to generate the story using the following prompt:

"Write a 400-word-long short story set in a greenhouse about how a mushroom, a frog, and a mouse defeat 
the human invader (the gardener) of their home. The defeat and death of the gardener results in their 
dead body being left to decay in the greenhouse, and for years after the greenhouse is reclaimed by 
nature and the plants growing within it run rampant over the skeleton of the gardener."
